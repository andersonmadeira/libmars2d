{"name":"libmars2d","tagline":"A Simple Game Engine for C++","body":"#### Motivation:\r\n\r\nThis project is an effort of making a simple game engine for easy development of 2D games in C++. There's no doubt that C/C++ is the most used programming language for game development because of its performance (refs needed), but many developers complain about issues that eventually come when choosing C++, most of them regarding pointers, memory management and their possible solutions that often lead to unreadable code. We need an easy-to-use API to build our 2D games with no need to deallocate resources or messing around with memory management, so we can spend more time with the logic and art of our game. ;)\r\n\r\n#### How to use:\r\n\r\nCheck the *test* directory, it contains usefull code samples of using the API.\r\n\r\n#### Contributions:\r\n\r\nAny kind of Contributions/PullRequests are welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
