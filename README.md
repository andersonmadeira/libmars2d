*A Simple Game Engine for C++*

#### Motivation:

This project is an effort of making a simple game engine for easy development of 2D games in C++. There's no doubt that C/C++ is the most used programming language for game development because of its performance (refs needed), but many developers complain about issues that eventually come when choosing C++, most of them regarding pointers, memory management and their possible solutions that often lead to unreadable code. So we need an easy-to-use API to build our 2D games with no need to deallocate resources and handling with memory management and spend more time with the logic and art of our game. ;)

#### How to use:

Check the *test* directory, it contains usefull code samples of using the API.

#### Contributions:

Any kind of Contributions/PullRequests are welcome.
